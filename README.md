🗓 Event Scheduler App (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
📘 Overview

The Event Scheduler App is a Node.js-based backend application designed to manage and automate event scheduling, reminders, and notifications. It provides RESTful APIs to create, update, cancel, archive, and retrieve events — all from a single endpoint structure. The system ensures efficient event handling with flexible reminder and archiving features.

🚀 Features

Add New Events: Create events with title, description, date, email, and phone notifications.

Update Events: Modify event details or reschedule easily.

Cancel / Archive Events: Mark events as canceled or move them to archive.

Smart Reminders: Supports reminderAt field for scheduling notifications before the event.

MongoDB Integration: All data is stored securely and efficiently using Mongoose.

Error Handling: Includes proper validation and detailed error responses.

Single Endpoint Support: All event-related actions can be handled via one route (/all-in-one) for flexibility.
